#Write a Python program that demonstrates inheritance by creating a base class Animal and derived classes like Dog, Cat, etc., each with their specific behaviors
#input

# Base class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

# Derived class 1
class Dog(Animal):

        print(f"{self.name} says Woof! Woof!")

# Derived class 2
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Meow!")

# Derived class 3 (optional extra)
class Cow(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Moo!")

# Create objects of each derived class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
cat1 = Cat("Whiskers")
cow1 = Cow("Daisy")

# Call their specific behaviors
dog1.speak()
cat1.speak()
cow1.speak()

#output
